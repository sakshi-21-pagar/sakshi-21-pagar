- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sakshi-21-pagar
- ðŸ‘€ My name is Sakshi yashwant pagar. I was born and brought up in Maharashtra - Other. However, I presently
put up in Nasik.
My highest degree is a full time BE / B.Tech in Information Technology from NDMVP Samajs College of
Engineering, Nashik that will complete in May-2022. My GPA out of 10 is 7.80.
My Information Technology degree(s) is giving a range of skills that I feel are crucial for my career and life.
Despite limited exposure, I have understood that hard work and determination can make anything possible. I
am ready to do that. Also, I am trying to develop a habit of reading current trends and industry news.
My project work(s) lasted for 5 Month(s) in total as I worked on Real-Time Driver-Drowsiness Detection
System Using. I would like to add that I am certified in 2 Month(s) Certificate Course in Web Application
Developer and 2 Month(s) Cyber security certificate.
When it comes to schooling, I secured 83.0% in my XIIth Maharashtra Senior Secondary examination in 2018.
In Xth Maharashtra Board, I got 84.0%. During my schooling, I developed strong communication skills and
also had the opportunity to participate and excel in several extracurricular activities. Because of these
exposures and experiences during my academic years, I have gradually been able to develop effective
communication skills. So, I can interact freely within a team.
To add, I am also skilled in Java, C, HTML, Javascript, CSS, IT, React.Js, Python and PHP. I can read, write
and speak in Marathi .
Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me
ahead in both my professional and personal life.
